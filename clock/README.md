# Clock

In this task you will use your newly gained transform knowledge to refactor the given file or [this codepen](https://codepen.io/nicokoenig/pen/KKwONWq) to look like [this codepen](https://codepen.io/nicokoenig/full/YzPBaOo).

## Todos

- [ ] Arrange the existing inner elements of `.clock`to form the time four o'clock

## Hints

- The transform property can help you to arrange the elements
- Position: absolute without offset properties will take an element out of the normal document flow but it will stay in its initial position
- When using transform you may also need to set the transform-origin property
- `align-self` will place an item individually on the cross axis
