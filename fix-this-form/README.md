# Fix This Form

In this task you will use our wisdom about CSS selectors to fix this broken form in the local file or on [codepen](https://codepen.io/nicokoenig/pen/eYmxGYO). When you are done, your form should look and behave like [this codepen](https://codepen.io/nicokoenig/full/ZEYwvGR).

## Rules

- **do not** edit the HTML
- **do not** edit the existing rulesets
- **only** add new CSS rulesets

## Todos

- [ ] Fix the typo in the heading, it should be "Join the Sith army!"
- [ ] Inputs have a red border, when they are not valid **and** contain text
- [ ] form has a green border, when all required fields are valid
- [ ] Hide the duplicate "join" button
- [ ] Add some spacing between the "Undo" and "Join" button
- [ ] Fade out (opacity) the submit button, when the form is invalid (this will not prevent the form from being sent, but that's not the point here)
