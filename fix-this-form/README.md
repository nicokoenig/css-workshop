# Fix This Form

In this task you will use our wisdom about CSS selectors to fix this broken form in the local file or on [codepen](https://codepen.io/nicokoenig/pen/eYmxGYO). When you are done, your form should look and behave like [this codepen](https://codepen.io/nicokoenig/full/ZEYwvGR).

## Rules

- Do not edit the HTML
- Do not edit the existing rulesets
- Only add new CSS rulesets

## Todos

- [ ] Fix the typo in the heading - it should be "Join the Sith army!"
- [ ] Inputs have a red border when they are not valid **and** contain text
- [ ] The form has a green border when all required fields are valid
- [ ] Hide the duplicate "join" button
- [ ] Add some spacing between the "Undo" and "Join" button
- [ ] Fade out (opacity) the submit button when the form is invalid (this will not prevent the form from being sent but that's not the point here)
